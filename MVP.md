# Metis Project 3: Wind Turbine Location - MVP 

### Analyzing wind speed in California

The goal of this project is to find locations in California that wind turbines would be most efficient in.

To achieve this goal, I calculated the average and maximum wind speed for each automated weather station in the state.

Using Google Sheets, I plotted both metrics in histograms, shown below.
